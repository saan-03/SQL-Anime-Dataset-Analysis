# SQL-Anime-Dataset-Analysis
With the popularity of anime soaring in the past few years, I wanted to analyze different factors resulting in such popularity.
I used SQLite3 to analyze the popularity of Japanese animes and related studios

Learning goals:
1. Use SQLite3 in Jupyter Notebooks
2. Develop analysis skills using SQL
3. Leaning basic analysis
